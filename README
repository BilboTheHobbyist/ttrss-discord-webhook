ttrss-discord-hook
==================

A plugin for TinyTinyRSS that adds a filter action so that new items received
by feeds can be sent as links to a Discord webhook previously configured in
the settings.

This is a very WIP plugin, so use under your own risk.

How to install? Copy the discord_hook directory to your plugins.local/
directory in your TinyTinyRSS install. If you are using Docker builds, you
can also bind the directory or something like that.
